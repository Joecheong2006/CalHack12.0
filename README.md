# CalHack12.0: Smart README Generator

## Project Description

This project is a Python-based tool designed to automatically generate comprehensive and professional README.md files for software projects. By scanning the project directory, analyzing code structure, and leveraging the OpenAI API, this tool aims to streamline documentation and improve project maintainability.  It automates the creation of READMEs, saving developers time and ensuring consistency across projects.

## Features

*   **Automated README Generation:** Scans the project directory and generates a README.md file.
*   **Code Analysis:** Analyzes code structure to infer project purpose and features.
*   **OpenAI API Integration:** Leverages the OpenAI API to generate descriptive and informative content.
*   **Dependency Extraction:** Identifies and lists project dependencies. (Currently rudimentary, future versions will improve dependency identification)
*   **Project Structure Overview:**  Provides a clear overview of the project's directory layout.
*   **Markdown Formatting:** Generates README files in standard Markdown format for easy readability.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    *   Python 3.6 or higher.
    *   An OpenAI API key.

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> #Replace <repository_url> with the actual git repo url
    cd CalHack12.0
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:** (While the project currently lacks explicit dependency management, future versions will include a `requirements.txt` file.)

    ```bash
    # Future: pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Currently, no dependencies are explicitly listed but future version will use the openai package
    # pip install openai # example of what a future version would require.
    ```

4.  **Set up OpenAI API key:**

    You will need to obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it as an environment variable or configure it directly within the script (not recommended for security reasons).

    *   **Environment Variable:** Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
        ```
        (Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual API key.)

## Usage

1.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python main.py <project_directory> <output_file>
    ```

    *   `<project_directory>`: The path to the project directory you want to document.
    *   `<output_file>`: The name of the output README.md file (e.g., `README.md`). If not provided, it will default to `README.md` in the project directory.

    Example:

    ```bash
    python main.py ./my_project README.md
    ```

2.  **Review and Edit:**

    After the script runs, review the generated `README.md` file and make any necessary edits to ensure accuracy and completeness.  The automated generation provides a strong foundation, but manual review is crucial.

## Project Structure

## Requirements/Dependencies

*   Python 3.6+
*   OpenAI API key.
*   (Future versions will explicitly require `openai` package.)
